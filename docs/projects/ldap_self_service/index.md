A NodeRED Full-Stack application for LDAP Self-Service. You can deploy this project by cloning the repo and adding to your NodeRED instance, or you can pull our docker image that is already setup for immediate spin-up. The latter only requires that you add your credential encryption key and the credentials for LDAP, GLPI and your OAuth2 provider.


## Features

Currently this project is a work-in-progress. Whilst it can be used, some features are still in the planning stage.
